# Hello Onlookers!

I'm bliz, a fullstack scripter based in America. If I've worked for you, great to know you dropped in.



## 📝 About Me
Everytime before I start working on a module, I have the tendency to Architect each and every sub-module, which can take hours. Then, I get started as if Intellisense was my best buddy. I like to say I code in futureproof but I always catch myself brainstorming for an extended while. HELP ME.

## Ways to say Hello World!

Here are 3 ways in 3 different languages in order to type 'hello world!'
Rule: Return a function returning hello world.
Optional: Unnecessarily Complex.

Typescript
```typescript
const helloFunction = (): string => {
	return new Promise((resolve: Callback) => {
		setTimeout(() => {
			resolve("Hello World!".lower());
		}, 0);
	}).expect();
};
console.log(helloFunction());
```

AHK v1
```autohotkey
    helloFunction() {
	static func := Func("returnHello").Bind()
	return func.Call()
}

returnHello() {
	return "hello world!"
}

MsgBox % helloFunction()
```

Luau
```lua
local function createHello()
	return (function() 
        return ("Hello World!"):lower()
    end)()
end
print(createHello())
```


## 🎨 3 Small  Fun Facts

1. I BARELY use github, but slowly starting to add small public stuff to it.

2. I'm really fast in learning languages, but I always make sure it's bug proof. Typescript is perfect for me!!

3. I started coding as a side hobby, but it slowly started growing on me somehow.
